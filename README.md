### Inferences:
### 1. Overall Overview on Regional Sales Performance;
Overall, the total sales generated by the regions decreased in 2024. The pivot table 2 shows the total sales generated each year. The total sales generated by the regions in 2024 was slightly above half of the total sales in 2023.
### 2. Sales Performance for each region;
East: East region had the highest sales in 2023 which indicates strong market prensence which may have been due to Petal's internet network reliability coverage. It has the lowest sales this year which may suggest increased competition and also ecenomic challenges such as rising inflation and decrease in cusomer spending.
West: The chart shows that west region is taking the lead among the regions in generating sales this year and it generated the least sales in 2023. The increase this year might be due to improved nextwork reliability.
North: North seems to show a stable growth in 2024. 
South: The second leading region in generating sales in the year 2024.
### 2. Strategic Intervention;
- Pestel Internet providers should invest in infrastructure to expand and improve their network reliability in all the regions which can reduce interruptions in the internect connection provided to the customers
- They can also create retention initiations e.g discounts and service upgrades to encourage customers to stay.

### Conclusion
To unlock the revenue potential in all the regions, Petal Internet Service Providers should focus on expanding infrastructure, improving network reliability, offering competitive pricing and improve on customer service.

  * The lower revenue contribution from Standard and Premium Subscriptions suggests that customers may not perceive enough value to want to upgrade.
### 3. Strategic Intervention;
 - Petal should enhance perceived value of Standard and Premium plans by adding exclusive features e.g bundled services or faster network speed.
